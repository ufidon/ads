# Algorithm efficiency analysis
chapter 22


Objectives
---
- Estimate algorithm efficiency using the Big O notation
  -  explain growth rates and 
     -  why constants and nondominating terms can be ignored
  - describe common growth functions 
    - constant, logarithmic, log-linear, quadratic, cubic, and exponential
- Analyze and determine the complexity of various types of algorithms
  -  binary search
  -  selection sort
  -  Tower of Hanoi
- Design efficient algorithms for 
  - finding 
    - Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming
    - the GCD using Euclidâ€™s algorithm
    - prime numbers using the sieve of Eratosthene
    - the closest pair of point using the divide-and-conquer approach
    - a convex hull for a set of points
  - solving
    -  the Eight Queens problem using the backtracking approach
    -  string matching using Boyer-Moor and KMP algorithms
