Representing Weighted Graphs 
---
- Representing Weighted Edges: Edge Array 
  - a [weighted edge](./demos/WeightedEdge.java): $(u, v, weight)$
  - $E=\{(v_1, v_3, w_{(1,3)}), (v_1, v_9, w_{(1,9)}), \cdots, (v_i, v_j, w_{(i,j)})\}$
  ```java
  int[][] edges = {{1,3,w1_3}, {1,9,w1_9}, ..., {i, j, wi_j}};
  ```
- Weighted Adjacency Matrices 
  ```java
  Integer[][] adjacencyMatrix = {
    {null, 1, 3},
    {-9, null, 0},
    {7, 10, 5}
  }
  ```
- Adjacency List of weighted edges
  ```java
  // 1. array of list of edges for each node
  List<WeightedEdge>[] neighbors = new List[edgeNumber];
  neighbors[0]=new ArrayList<WeightedEdge>(); neighbors[1]=new ArrayList<WeightedEdge>();
  neighbors[1].add(new WeightedEdge(1,3,2.5));
  neighbors[1].add(new WeightedEdge(1,9,7.8));
  // 2. list of list of edges for each node
  List<List<WeightedEdge>> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```

Design and test class WeightedGraph

- extends UnweightedGraph\<V\>

- [TestWeightedGraph.java](./demos/TestWeightedGraph.java)


Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)
---
- A connected graph may have many spanning trees 
- A MST is a spanning tree with the minimum total weights
- ![minimum spanning trees](images/msts.png)


Find MST with Prim's algorithm
---
```java
Input: G = (V, E) with non-negative weights. 
Output: a MST
MST minimumSpanningTree() {
  Let V denote the set of vertices in the graph;
  Let T be a set for the vertices in the spanning tree;
  Initially, add the starting vertex to T;
  while (size of T < n) {
    find v in T and u in V ‚Äì T with the smallest weight 
      on the edge (u, v), as shown in the figure;
    add u to T;
  }
}
```

Practice üìù 
---
- run [Prim's algorithm](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Prim.html)


Refine Prim's algorithm
---
```java
Input: a graph G = (V, E) with non-negative weights
Output: a minimum spanning tree with the starting vertex s as the root
MST getMinimumSpanngingTree(s) {
  Let T be a set that contains the vertices in the spanning tree; 
  Initially T is empty;
  Set cost[s] = 0; and cost[v] = infinity for all other vertices in V;
    
  while (size of T < n) {
    Find u not in T with the smallest cost[u];
    Add u to T;
    for (each v not in T and (u, v) in E) 
      if (cost[v] > w(u, v)) {
        cost[v] = w(u, v); parent[v] = u;
     }
  }
}
```
- time complexity: $O(n^3)$
  - can be improved to $O(n^2)$

---
- WeightedGraph\<V\>.MST extends UnweightedGraph\<V\>.SearchTree

Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
---
```java
Input: a graph G = (V, E) with non-negative weights
Output: a shortest path tree with the source vertex s as the root
ShortestPathTree getShortestPath(s) {
  Let T be a set that contains the vertices whose 
    paths to s are known; Initially T is empty;
  Set cost[s] = 0; and cost[v] = infinity for all other vertices in V;
    
  while (size of T < n) {
    Find u not in T with the smallest cost[u];
    Add u to T;
    for (each v not in T and (u, v) in E) 
      if (cost[v] > cost[u] + w(u, v)) {
        cost[v] = cost[u] + w(u, v); parent[v] = u;
      }
  }
}
```
